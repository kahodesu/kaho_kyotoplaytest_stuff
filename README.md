All the code from "Touch" project I made at Playtest Kyoto. 
The sound sampler box is from this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ak2o5ZDI9I
that uses this Sound Sampler project: https://homspace.nl/samplerbox/
And the Arduino Nano is used to identify that a circuit is being made, then controls the sound sampler.

The ATmega328 on the Arduino Nano provides UART TTL (5V) serial communication which is needed for the microcontroller to send MIDI signals.
